Docker Architecture :

Docker Engine
Docker is the client-server type of application which means we have clients who relay to the server. So the Docker daemon called: dockerd is the Docker engine which represents the server. 

Docker Images
Docker images are the "source code" for our containers; we use them to build containers. They can have software pre-installed which speeds up deployment. They are portable, and we can use existing images or build our own.

Registries
Docker stores the images we build in registries. There are public and private registries. Docker company has public registry calledÂ Docker hub, where you can also store images privately. 

Docker Containers
Containers are the organizational units of Docker. When we build an image and start running it; we are running in a container..
In simple terms, an image is a template, and a container is a copy of that template. You can have multiple containers (copies) of the same image.
